Prerequisits:

Step 1) Learn Basics of Python - recommended
Step 2) Know Higher Level Maths (college level) -  recommended (not a must)
Step 3) Learn and implement Algorithms - recommended (not a must) 
Step 4) For theoretical knowledge visit coursera and take Andrew Ng free Introduction to Machine Learning course. - recommended


Algorithms:

For starting with algorithms read a book like CLRS of have coursera free introduction to algorithms course (Better than book) of use MIT OCW
goto codechef (for help, just ask a qustion and people will help you out) or codeforces (recommended for problems solving)
got to problemset of problems and then sort them by the max solved as easiest one will be more solved by people, like print hello world will be more solved than a complex problme
read problem
write code in any language as the format they specify strictly and then output the same format as asked
use sublime test editor 

for c++ setup
install mingw
install sublime
youtube for how to setup sublime for competetive programming
google how to run cpp code in sublime as you'll need a build tool for that purpose


Python: Watch CS Dojo python videos on youtube or on freecodecamp implement or you may find this one easily.


Practical Implementation of ML:


One Way:
Go to youtube and search for google developers youtube official google channel and look for their Machine Learning Playlist (of ML with cloud)


Another way i suggest:
google and download install anaconda with python 3.6 or above (will install everything like python, and all libraries needed)
Go to Kaggle
sign-up
goto competetion
goto titanic disaster problem
goto data tab and download all files to local storage
goto tutorials page of titanic problem under data tab itself
there under getting started with python
either go with scikit learn link where youtube videos will be available for beginners
or i suggest if done with coursera then
in external tutorials section at last click on python which redirects to datacamp website which is best for implementation side by side.

Thankyou
